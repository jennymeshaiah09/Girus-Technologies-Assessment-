# Girus-Technologies-Assessment

This repository contains solutions to the coding assessment puzzles assigned by **Girus Technologies**. Each puzzle is implemented in **Python** with **hardcoded inputs** for clarity and demonstration.

## ðŸ“‚ Structure

The repository is organized into 5 folders, one for each puzzle:

- `puzzle1` â€“ Sudoku Validator With Custom Zones  
- `puzzle2` â€“ Alien Dictionary (Character Order Inference)  
- `puzzle3` â€“ Knights and Portals (Grid Pathfinding with One Teleport)  
- `puzzle4` â€“ Bitwise Matching Pattern (Next Integer with Same Binary 1s)  
- `puzzle5` â€“ Matrix Islands With Diagonal Connectivity  

Each folder contains a single `.py` file that directly runs the logic with test input.

## ðŸ§ª Notes

- All inputs are **hardcoded** within each script.
- No external libraries are required beyond Python standard modules (`collections`, etc.).
- Solutions focus on **clarity**, **correctness**, and **simplicity**.

## ðŸ”§ Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
